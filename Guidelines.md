## Coding Guidelines:

##### Python 3:

For python3 follow *[pep8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/?)* and *The Zen Of Python*

###### PEP8 Guidelines
For the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/?) Guidelines, the only exception is to use tabs instead of 4 spaces. This is for disk space and keeping moving between code easy.

###### Zen of Python

The Zen of Python can be viewed by typing ```import this``` in the Python console

```
>>> import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Versioning Guidelines:

###### Original Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Degree_of_compatibility)

###### Direct Quote:

Designating development stage
Some schemes use a zero in the first sequence to designate alpha or beta status for releases that are not stable enough for general or practical deployment and are intended for testing or internal use only.

It can be used in the third position:

* 0 for alpha (status)
* 1 for beta (status)
* 2 for release candidate
* 3 for (final) release
